After that, open the DMG file, and then double click on this package, this will lunch an installation wizard which is pretty easy to use, so simply click on continue and againg and again, agree with the licese agreement, and install MySQL. 
it's going to ask for your password, this is the password that you used to log into your computerm so let's put that here.
Now we need to set a password to the root for the admin user. So click next and in this box type a complex password and finish the installation, and enter your computer password one more time, And we are DONE!

*That was super easy :)*

We installed MySQL community server, now we need the graphical tool to connect with this server and manage our databases. So back to the [Download page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)  you should see **MySQL workbench**

Finally drag MySQL workbench into applicaion, then press **command + space** and search for MySQL workbench, let's open it!
